### Project Feedback + Evaluation

* __Project Workflow__: **Meets Expectations**

>Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program you’re in (detailed above)?

***Great job on the planning portion and creating user stories. Also, great job using branches and having frequent git commits!***


* __Technical Requirements__: **Exceeds Expectations**

>Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

***Your memory game not only is very functional and rather complex, the interface is awesome, and it’s extremely creative. Also, your CSS/SASS is exceptional! I love the user interface and design of your game.***


* __Code Quality__: **Exceeds Expectations**

>Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

 ***It's great that you were able to put all of your code into a game object, eliminate global variables, and spend time refactoring your code. I left comments that further help to explain how I might go about refactoring it even more.***


* __Problem Solving__: Meets Expectations

>Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

***You definitely were able to solve your problem and had opportunity to focus on your "silver" or "gold" level objectives. Awesome job!***
