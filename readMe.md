## User Stories:
<!--I think your really close on the user stories here but I still think it's missing a more specifics. A user story describes the type of user, what they want and why -->
<!--For example for the user story below, although it may be implied, there should be an indication of who this user story is for. It should read more like "As a user, I could be able to click on a card, and it's corresponding font should be displayed so they can see the card's image"   -->
* When I click a card, the font should be displayed
<!--The user story below is a little confusing  -->
* When I have two cards revealed, they should be compared and either disappear or completely if matching or go back to their original state if the pair is not a match
* When I click "Play Timed Game" a 30 second countdown should be displayed
* If I am playing a timed game and have not won by the end of 30 seconds, a screen should be displayed saying I lost
* If I match all the pairs and clear the board, a screen should appear telling me that I won the game
* If I match all the pairs and clear the board, then leave the screen up for the timer to run out, the loser screen should not appear and the countdown should disappear
* If I click one of the colored boxes, it should change the color of the deck of cards
* When I refresh the page or play a new game, the cards should be shuffled in a different order
